🎯 Student Marks Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts student marks based on study hours using a simple Linear Regression model built in Python.
It is my first Machine Learning project created to understand the complete ML workflow.

📌 Problem Statement

Students often want to know how their study time impacts marks.
This model learns the relationship between study hours → marks and predicts expected scores.

⚙️ Technologies Used

🚀 How to Run

Install required libraries:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn


Start Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook


Open:

MarksPrediction.ipynb


Run all cells.

📊 Output

The model predicts marks based on study hours and shows a graph comparing:
